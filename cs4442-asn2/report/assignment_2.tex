\section{About}

The vast majority of this assignment's code is found in \verb|include/kbright2|. The source files for each executable are found in \verb|src/kbright2/p*| where \verb|p1| implies problem 1, etc.. Each file in \verb|include/kbright2| is documented with its functionality. The objects/namespaces instances are documented inline with what each method or object does. Unit tests were written to cover some of these objects as they were used consistently. In completing unit tests, \verb|test/catch/catch.hpp| was added as a dependency to this project. The file is not written by the author and is available at \href{http://catch-lib.net/}{Catch Lib}. This project is built via CMake and has been tested on Linux and Mac OS X. It has no external dependencies, thus should run without concern on Windows.

%	PROBLEM 1
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% To have just one problem per page, simply put a \clearpage after each problem

\begin{homeworkProblem}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]

\item Program for \verb|P1| is found in \verb|src/kbright2/p1/p1.cpp|. 
\item \autoref{table:P1_Dostoevsky_vs_Dostoevsky} shows the results of running \verb|P1| against the two Dostoevsky parts. With $N$ of $6$, the zero percentage nearly becomes $100\%$. It is likely to converge to zero, but is asymptotic due to the authors literary style and the input data. While increasing $N$ to $12$, I found that there is a passage in which a character recalls a conversation verbatim which means that there will be an N-gram which is common that matches the entire recollection, $N = 17$, ``repulsion that s what i m afraid of that s what may be too much for me''. Thus the largest $N$ with no common values is $N = 18$. 

To ease the problem of finding the longest ngram, I wrote a simple C++ source to find it based on a maximum $N$ value. This file is shown in \autoref{src:p1-find-longest.cpp}. To perform the action for this question, I used: \verb|P1-find-longest ./DostoevskyPart1.txt ./DostoevskyPart2.txt 18|, alternatively using the solution, \verb|P1|, one could run it for $N = 1..N_{max}$ until the proper value is found. 

\begin{table}[hc]

2                              & 34.6                            \\

\srcfile{p1-find-longest.cpp}{Find longest ngram source file.}{src/kbright2/p1/p1-find-longest.cpp}

\item This problem asked to repeat the previous problem using ``Dickens.txt'' and ``KafkaTrial.txt''. The results are shown in \autoref{table:P1_Dickens_vs_KafkaTrial}. Using \autoref{src:p1-find-longest.cpp}, the longest common n-grams were found to be: ``there is no such thing as a'' and ``in the middle of the table and.'' The largest $N$ with no common values is $N = 8$.

\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{N}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{\%}} \\ \midrule
1                              & 7.1                             \\

4                              & 98.8                            \\

\label{table:P1_Dickens_vs_KafkaTrial}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\item This problem used ``MarxEngelsManifest.txt'' and ``Smith-WealthNations.txt'' for comparison. The results are shown in \autoref{table:P1_MarxManifest_vs_SmithWealth}. Using \autoref{src:p1-find-longest.cpp}, the smallest $N$ with no common n-grams is $7$, and the longest common n-grams were found as: 
\begin{itemize}
\item ``to keep up the rate of''
\item ``in order to keep up the''
\item ``is the same as that of''
\item ``from them what they have not''
\item ``of a man s own labour''
\item ``of nature and of reason the''
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lr@{}}
\toprule
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{N}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{\%}} \\ \midrule
1 & 22 \\
2 & 74.8 \\
3 & 96.7 \\
4 & 99.7 \\
5 & 100.0 \\
6 & 100.0 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\cprotect\caption{Results of: \verb|P1 ./MarxEngelsManifest.txt ./SmithWealthNations.txt <N> 0|. }
\label{table:P1_MarxManifest_vs_SmithWealth}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\item The differences between the different values are based entirely on the textual content. For the first dataset, they are the same author and same book split into two. This means that there is a high likely hood of occurrence of something such as the "recollection" passage creating the common ngram of size 18. The second set of values converged quickly because there is no commonality between either the textual content or the authors. This leads into why the third set has commonalities; the content is an opposing view point of the same subject matter by different authors. This implies that each author will dispute the same points, however, they each have different writing styles and will not write the same stylistically.

\item Running \verb|P3| with ``MarxEngelsManifest.txt'' produced the following sentence for $N = 3$: ``their periodical return put on its part german socialism recognised more and more vanishing owing to the german philistines $\langle$END$\rangle$''. From the content of each sentence, it is very obvious that they were trained with different documents. The first talks about a trial and lies, large topics in the KafkaTrail document. The latter discusses socialism which is one of the founding principles of the Marxist Manifest. 

\item ``him so right in her but kept secret resentment towards the candle so big spite of him $\langle$END$\rangle$''

\item There is not a clear cut answer as to which parameter, Delta or N improves performance. Delta can cause hinderances with performance due to the formula \textit{not} taking the language model into account. This means that while delta helps to smooth out the missing values, it can actually add more false positives to the results. That being said, having a delta always is better than the MLE approach.  

\item Results are shown in \autoref{table:P5_f}.

\item The data output is shown in \autoref{table:P5_bcd2}. The data for the 256-character model is vastly better than the 26 character model. While the full latin model may have false characters (punctuation) it also pulls in characters that differentiate languages making it \textbf{much} better than the latin-only model which will not have the ability to consider those characters.
